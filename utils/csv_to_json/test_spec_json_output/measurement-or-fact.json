  "description": "A measurement of or fact about a class within the standard, or a relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated class. This class can be used to apply measurements, facts or narratives to the ObjectGroup as a whole, or used to qualify the relationship between the ObjectGroup and an associated attribute. For example, an ObjectGroup may contain 100 objects, of which 40 are from Europe and 60 from Africa. In this example, one MeasurementOrFact (count of 100) would be attached to the ObjectGroup, and one to each of the two relationships between the ObjectGroup and GeographicContext (Europe: count of 40, Africa: count of 60).",
