  "description": "A qualified association between a Person or OrganisationalUnit and an entity such as an ObjectGroup or MeasurementOrFact that enables the relationship to be contextualised with a specific role and time period. This class is aligned with the prov:qualifiedAttribution property (http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#qualifiedAttribution). It should be used instead of the Activity and PersonActivity classes to link a Person or OrganisationalUnit to an entity in situations where an activity is not know or is irrelevant, for example for describing a person's role within an organisation. It is not mandatory to link to either a Person or a Role in this class, to support use cases where a role is known but the person who fulfilled it is not, and where a person is known to have been involved but the context is not. However, it's expected that at least one of the hasPerson and hasRole properties is populated.",
