We have made every effort to guarantee that the translations of our normative and non-normative documentation are both of high quality and accurate. 
The translated content must meet a specific threshold in terms of both quantity and quality (completed by a native or fluent speaker) in order to be 
published. Please contact the point of contact indicated below if you discover a mistake or questionable translation. 

You can help! To help us translate our normative and non-normative documents, please get in touch with the designated translation point of contact or the 
conveners of a standard. You may also reach out to the chair of the Technical Architecture Group, Ben Norton <michaelnorton.ben@gmail.com>.  
Thanks!
