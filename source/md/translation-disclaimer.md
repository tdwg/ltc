We have made every effort to ensure that the translations of our normative and non-normative documentation are both accurate and of high quality. 
In order to be published, the translated content on a page must satisfy a minimum standard. Upon reaching this milestone, the remaining content will be translated as resources become available. 
  
You can help! To contribute to our effort to translate our normative and non-normative documentation, please contact the 
conveners of the standard of interest or the Chair of the Technical Architecture Group, Ben Norton at [mailto:michaelnorton.ben@gmail.com](michaelnorton.ben@gmail.com)
Thanks  
- Ben
