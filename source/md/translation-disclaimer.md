We have made every effort to ensure that the translations of our normative and non-normative documentation are both accurate and of high quality. To be published, the translated content on a page must satisfy a minimum standard. Upon reaching this milestone, the remaining content will be translated as resources become available.
  
You can help! To help us translate our normative and non-normative documents, please get in touch with the designated translation point of contact or the conveners of a standard. You may also reach out to the chair of the Technical Architecture Group, Ben Norton <michaelnorton.ben@gmail.com>.  
Thanks!
