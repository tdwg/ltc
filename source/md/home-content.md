Latimer Core (LtC) is a data standard for describing collections, proposed by the Collection Descriptions Task Group. It has been designed to support the representation and discovery of groups of items that are encompassed in collections and their subcomponents. The LtC classes and their properties (collectively called terms) aim to represent information that describes these groups of things in enough detail to inform deeper discovery of the resources they contain.

## Public Review 

The Public Review for the Latimer Core Standard is planned for December 2023. Multiple ways will be available to contribute during the review period. Please read the following to figure out which is best for you.

Only the Normative Term List [https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/terms/index.html](https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/terms/index.html) is subject to review. All other documentation, including the wiki(https://github.com/tdwg/ltc/wiki/1.-Overview-of-Latimer-Core) and resources page(https://tdwg.github.io/ltc/resources/), are non-normative and not subject to the Public Review. The purpose of the non-normative documentation is to improve understanding and clarify the normative documentation.

Standard live and die based on community. Without community support, a standard is just a organized list of random words. 
The public review is one of the best opportunities to support standards and the standardization process. 
You are free to leave public feedback or post anonymously by sending me a direct message over slack or email. 
I even accept notes tied to Game of Thrones style ravens.  
Thanks!
