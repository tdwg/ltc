  "description": "An informal classification of the type of objects within the ObjectGroup, using a hierarchical structure. This class is used to categorise the ObjectGroup according to an informal, self-referential hierarchy. For example, this can be used to create a hierarchy encompassing biological, geological and anthropological collections, where a single formal taxonomy isn't appropriate.",
