Where the same objects within the same collection might be described by more than one ObjectGroup for different purposes (for examples, a 'Darwin Fossil Mammals' collection description might overlap with a 'Offsite Palaeontology' collection description), this class can be used to distinguish between them and avoid double-counting of metrics in queries against the data.",
